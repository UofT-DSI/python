    "## Writing and Running Code in VS Code with Jupyter Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Writing Code Cells:**\n",
    "   - Use code cells to write your Python code. To create a new code cell, click on the `+ Code` button in the Jupyter toolbar.\n",
    "   - Type or paste your Python code within the code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Running Code Cells:**\n",
    "   - To execute a code cell, you can:\n",
    "     - Click the `Run Cell` button (a triangle icon) in the Jupyter toolbar.\n",
    "     - Use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`.\n",
    "   - Output, if any, will be displayed below the cell after execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**\n",
    "   - Utilize keyboard shortcuts for faster execution:\n",
    "     - `Shift + Enter`: Run the current cell and move to the next cell.\n",
    "     - `Ctrl + Enter`: Run the current cell and stay on the same cell.\n",
    "     - `Alt + Enter`: Run the current cell and insert a new cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Assistance and Auto-completion:**\n",
    "   - The Jupyter extension in VS Code offers code assistance and auto-completion. Press `Tab` for suggestions while writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Saving and Renaming:**\n",
    "   - Save your Jupyter notebook by clicking on `File` > `Save` or `File` > `Save As...`.\n",
    "   - To rename the notebook, right-click on the notebook file in the file explorer on the left and select `Rename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Managing Cells:**\n",
    "   - Use the `+ Code` or `+ Markdown` buttons in the Jupyter toolbar to add new code or text cells, respectively.\n",
    "   - You can rearrange the order of cells by clicking and dragging them in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "   - Right-click on a cell in the Jupyter notebook to access options like deleting or moving the cell."
