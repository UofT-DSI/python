    "Errors indicate that there is something in the code that the computer cannot execute. We will see some of the reasons that can happen. When an error occurs, Python produces an error message called a _traceback_. Tracebacks can be quite cryptic, but they tell us what code was running at the time of the error. When in doubt, copying the error message at the bottom of a traceback into a search engine can help.\n",

    "* **White space**: A space to either side of an operand helps readability. We can also split code across multiple lines by wrapping it in parentheses.\n",
