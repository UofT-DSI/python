## Description

The course will focus on the essentials of coding in Python. You will learn how to design functions, repeat code using loops, store data in lists, test and debug your code, and manipulate data using various data analysis and visualization tools such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
  
## Learning Outcomes
After successfully completing the course, the students will:
1. Understand various Python data types and their role in coding. This includes being able to differentiate and evaluate expressions using numeric types (integer, long, and floating-point numbers), Booleans, strings, and lists. This will be assessed in Assignment 1.
2. Be able to reduce the duplication of code by following the Function Design Recipe and create functions in Python. This will be assessed in Assignment 1.
3. Be able to use `numpy` and `pandas` to analyze a dataset, more specifically, be able to use these libraries to manipulate numerical and tabular data in Python. This will be assessed in Assignment 1 and 2.
4. Know how to interact with databases via Python. This includes using visualization techniques like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`. This will be assessed in Assignment 2.
5. Know how to debug and test Python code. Students will learn to troubleshoot errors and to select test cases to check for correctness, reliability, and robustness of code. This will be assessed in Assignment 1 and 2.

## Course Contacts
* Instructor: **Kaylie Lau** (she/her). Emails to the instructor can be sent to kaylie.lau@mail.utoronto.ca.
* TA: **Tong Su** (she/her). Emails to the teaching assistant can be sent to tong.su@mail.utoronto.ca.

## Pre-Course Work
Prior to the first class please:
1. Create a Google account that can use Google Colab:
	1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/. In the upper left corner, click File, then New Notebook
	2. Enter `!python --version` in the code cell, then hit ctrl+enter to run the cell and confirm that your Python version is 3.6 or above.
	* If you are having issues with the set-up, the TA will be available to help with **Monday 11 December from 5:30 PM -6:00 PM**.
2. Complete the pre-course survey: https://forms.gle/tn8a5aFC4ZNUfvQs5
 
## Design
The course runs synchronously over Zoom. It consists of eight classes over the span of two weeks. Classes are 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM EDT on weekdays, and 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM EDT on Saturday. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one or two breaks during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.
 

Tutorial sessions with a TA will also be offered over Zoom. These will take place from 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM EDT and 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM on weekdays, and 8:30 AM - 9:00 AM EDT and 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM EDT on Saturday. 
 
## Schedule
Schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.
* **Day 1 (Monday 11 December, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Getting Started I (Introduction; Python fundamentals)
* **Day 2 (Tuesday 12 December, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Getting Started II (Python fundamentals)
* **Day 3 (Wednesday 13 December, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Dealing with Reality (Control flow using conditionals and loops; Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries)
* **Day 4 (Thursday 14 December, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** In/Out (Modules; Working with files; Object-oriented programming)
* **Day 5 (Saturday 16 December, 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM):** Doing More with Data I (`numpy`)
* **Day 6 (Monday 18 December, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Doing More with Data II (`pandas`)
* **Day 7 (Tuesday 19 December, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Case Study Speaker
* **Day 8 (Wednesday 20 December, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Visualizing Data (`matplotlib`; `seaborn`; `plotly`)

## Prerequisites
Learners are expected to know how to operate a computer and are also expected to be familiar with the parts of a data table or spreadsheet, summary statistics, and basic data visualizations. No prior programming knowledge is required.

## Expectations
The course is a live-coding class. Learners are expected to follow along with the coding in their own Python notebooks. Learners should be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout. Although slides will be available, they should be referenced before or after class, as class will be dedicated to coding with the instructor.
 
### Technology requirements
* Learners must have an internet connection and a computer to participate in online activities
* Learners must have a Google account that can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
 
## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this course more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Course communications:** Communications take place over email. Please include "DSI-Python" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Python: pandas question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which is **not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be three assignments which **are** graded.
